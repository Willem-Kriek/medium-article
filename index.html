    <h3>What is Biltong?</h3>
      <p>Biltong is a form of dried, cured meat which originated in Southern African countries
        (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho , Eswatini and Zambia).
        Various types of meat are used to produce it, ranging from beef to game meats such as
        ostrich or kudu. The cut may also vary being either fillets of meat cut into strips following
        the grain of the muscle, or flat pieces sliced across the grain.

        The word "biltong" is from the Dutch bil ("buttock") and tong ("strip" or "tongue").</p>

      <h3>Origins?</h3>
      <p>During the European colonization of South Africa, particularly in the 17th century, Dutch
        settlers and later British colonists adopted and adapted indigenous food preservation techniques.
        he result was biltong, a method of curing and drying meat, typically beef or game meats, with
        a mixture of vinegar, salt, and spices. This process not only served as a practical means of
        preserving meat in a time before refrigeration but also added unique flavors to the final product.</p>
